Online Reputation Management (ORM) refers to strategic efforts made by 
organizations to influence, monitor, and control how their brand is perceived across 
various online platforms such as search engines, social media, and review portals. 
ORM is critical for businesses because digital platforms can quickly amplify both 
positive and negative information, thereby directly affecting consumer trust and 
purchasing decisions. 
Importance of ORM in Digital Marketing 
The digital marketing landscape has evolved to prioritize customer sentiment and 
brand perception. ORM plays a central role by: 
 Building and maintaining trust. 
 Increasing customer engagement. 
 Mitigating the damage from negative feedback. 
 Improving advocacy and loyalty. 
 Enhancing search engine rankings (SEO), given that reviews and mentions 
contribute to visibility. 
Without an active ORM strategy, brands risk loss of sales, tarnished reputation, 
and reduced competitiveness in the digital era.
